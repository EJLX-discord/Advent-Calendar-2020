      <p>Merry Christmas!<br/>At first, I&apos;m hoping you guys are having great holidays.</p>
      <p>Lately I&apos;m having a lot of to do in my life. like, my gramma got dementia, also my job became really really busy for some reasons, even though I speak English every days with some of my friends on the VC.</p>
      <p>My next year&apos;s resolutions are</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Speak/listen in English better than now.</li>
        <li>Learn English way more accurate in some Univ.</li>
        <li>Take the license, called &quot;1st class Qualified Certified Electrician&quot;.</li>
        <li>Cherish my precious friend, also family, and gramma.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>3 of those resolutions were related by the COVID sadly...<br/>
      But... I mean...</p>
      <p>Everything definitely will be fine.<br/>At this moment, the entire world on fire. But STAY STRONG EVERYONE!!!!</p>
      <p>After this COVID became better, let&apos;s hangout like good old days, hm??</p>
      <p>Please take care for your healthy life, and make your year the best one next year!! friends!</p>
      <p>Happy new year!!!!</p>
