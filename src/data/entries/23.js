      <p>I love programming (On whatever systems; like microcomputers, actual &quot;computers&quot;).<br/>
      So I think I&apos;ll talk about it.</p>

      <p>Pros about Microcomputers</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Microcomputers are fun to code, and can bring your code into material world.</li>
        <li>Some of those microcomputers (Board or MPU or whatnot) are cheap enough that you can buy it below 10$</li>
        <li>Many common interfaces that you don&apos;t find on ordinal PC. (SPI/I2C/USART etc...)</li>
        <li>Some MCUs does have frameworks and manuals, and some snippets you can use</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Cons about Microcomputers</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Resources are limited.</li>
        <li>Often, RAM, FLASH, ROM is limited; if you get 32K RAM consider those plenty :P</li>
        <li>Documents can be tedious to read.</li>
        <li>Some MCUs doesn&apos;t have consolidated manual nor framework</li>
      </ul>

      <p>here&apos;s some of my recommendations of MCU you can get.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>ESP32 - Espressif&apos;s 32-bit Core. comes with big flash and RAMs.</li>
        <li>Seeduino series - Powerful 48MHz core.</li>
        <li>Arduino Series - Uno and Mega. 8-bit but pincount and cheapness is good.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>That&apos;s it, for my advent calendar. (Also uh, DM me if you wanna more recommendation!)</p>
