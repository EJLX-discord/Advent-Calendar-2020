      Advent Calendar 30th December 2020
    </div>
    <div>
      <p>First of all, I am very happy to join the Advent Calendar .<br/>
      I got an idea of a story when I received one picture from my friend Daku. It was an image of his cat. His name is Ruka. </p>
      <br/>
      <p>『  Hear me out ！ 』</p>

      <p>Ruka🐱  &quot; There&apos;s something I want to ask you..... It seems that there are really delicious foods in Japan that I can lick and eat . I was wondering if you can buy it here in America ,too.  But I would really love to go to Japan one day .<br/>
      I know some Japanese <br/>
      「 SUSHI 」 「 TEMPURA 」 「 PARIDON 」「 KAWAII 」  「EMOI 」  「 PIENN 」</p>

      <p>Daku 🧒  &quot;Huh？  when did you learn such Japanese？&quot;</p>

      <p>Ruka🐱   &quot;I &apos;ve been watching you study Japanese everyday beside me.  So you don&apos;t have to be so surprised . But I know that you don&apos;t get anything of what I mean when you hear me just say <br/>
      【 meow】</p>

      <img src={image} alt={'A beautiful cat on a wooden floor'} className={'entry-image'} />

      <p>Thank you very much to read my story.<br/>
      And<br/>
      Yoi otoshi wo .<br/>
      You may be happy new year.</p>
