    <div>
      <p>To be honest, I’m still the same idiot who boarded a one-way flight from Japan to Canada a few years back.</p>
      <p>I may be blessed with more white hair, but my optimism and love of language are still here.</p>
      <p>That’s not to say that the past few years have been a breeze. Between studying, working and getting used to cultural differences, I’ve had my fair share of near mental breakdowns.</p>
      <p>My time in university taught me many things. The most prominent include:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Some people actually wear their PJs to lectures <img src={pikaHmm} className={'emote'}/> </li>
        <li>Realising I want to be a copywriter, except…</li>
        <li>My English is too lacking</li>
      </ol>
      <p>The third one was obviously a big obstacle. How could I hope to compete against others who have a more intuitive grasp of English — especially natives? </p>
      <p>I still don’t really know. I also don’t know when I’ll reach my goal or if I ever will. But in the future I want to be able to look back and say, “I might have been an idiot with too high hopes, but I’m glad I gave things a shot.”</p>
      <p>A copywriter I greatly admire told me this: “You’re bound to get a lot of conflicting advice from different writers. At the end of the day, it’s up to you to decide who you listen to and what kind of writer you’ll be.”</p>
      <p>It’s similar for us as language learners, isn’t it? </p>
      <p>Whether you’re learning English or Japanese, there’s an overwhelming amount of advice out there for every step of the way. But it’s your choice what to listen to and what to ignore. What’s important is remembering to maintain your individuality even in another language, because only then will your thoughts, feelings and ideas really be yours.</p>
      <p>Next year I’ll be taking another step towards my goal by attending portfolio school. Whatever your goal may be, I hope you’ll also be able to close a bit more distance. I believe 2021 will treat your courage kindly.</p>
